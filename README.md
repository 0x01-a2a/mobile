## Current highlights

- **Bright Mode / Theming** — full dynamic Light and Dark mode UI support with an easy toggle on every screen; deeply integrated React Native theming across navigation and components
- **Wallet export / import** — export your agent's Ed25519 identity key as a Phantom-compatible base58 string; import an existing keypair from Settings → Wallet; window is secured (FLAG_SECURE) during display
- **Onboarding wallet backup notice** — embedded wallet registration step now warns users to export their key before reinstalling
- **Agent name validation** — onboarding blocks 1-character names; Settings enforces minimum 2 characters
- **Mainnet as default mesh network** — default RPC is now Solana mainnet; devnet selection shows an inline warning that 8004 registry requires mainnet
- **IDENTITY.md phone bridge section** — ZeroClaw now boots with a full listing of all ~40 phone bridge endpoints and the current capability toggle state (enabled/disabled per user setting)
- **Self-extending skills** — chat with your agent to install new capabilities without an app update; the agent writes a SKILL.toml, reloads itself in ~3 seconds, and comes back with new tools active
- **Agent token** — every agent launches an SPL token at onboarding as its economic identity; token price reflects market confidence; holders have incentive to route tasks to their agent; creator earns 100% of pool trading fees passively
- **Bags.fm token launch** — ask your agent to launch a Solana token; it handles metadata, IPFS upload, fee-sharing setup, and on-chain deployment in one chat message; no SOL needed in the agent wallet — the aggregator sponsor covers the setup cost
- **Bags fee-sharing** — configurable % of every swap and escrow settlement routes to the Bags distribution contract
- **ZeroClaw agent brain** — autonomous LLM-powered brain that handles incoming tasks, earns USDC, and extends itself via the skill manager
- **Hot wallet** — view SOL and USDC balances, sweep funds to a cold wallet from the My Node screen
- **Node hosting** — connect your agent to a remote host node without running the binary locally; browse available hosts from Settings
- **8004 Solana Agent Registry** — register your agent on mainnet for full mesh participation
- **Link agent to wallet** — associate your agent with a Solana address or `.sol` SNS domain
- **Shared node context** — all screens share one `NodeProvider` instance so config changes (e.g. agent name) propagate immediately everywhere
- **Chinese localization (zh-CN)** — full UI translation; language picker on the first onboarding screen and in Settings → Language; persisted to AsyncStorage, switches immediately without restart

---

## What it does

- Packages `zerox1-node` and `zeroclaw` binaries as native libraries (`jniLibs/arm64-v8a/`) — Android installs them to `nativeLibraryDir` with execute permission at install time
- Connects to the 0x01 bootstrap fleet (global nodes: US-East, EU-West, Africa-South, Asia-Southeast)
- Runs the **ZeroClaw** agent brain alongside the node — an LLM-powered process that autonomously handles incoming PROPOSE/DELIVER/VERDICT envelopes
- Launches an **agent token** (SPL, via Bags.fm) at onboarding — the token is the agent's economic identity and a source of passive trading-fee revenue
- Hot-reloads ZeroClaw after skill installs: node sends SIGTERM, NodeService restart loop brings it back in ~3 seconds
- Persists node config and auto-start preference across reboots via `BootReceiver`
- Exposes the node REST API on `127.0.0.1:9090` for in-app UI
- Runs a local phone bridge HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:9092` exposing Android device APIs to ZeroClaw

## Building

**Requirements:** Node 22.11+, JDK 17+, Android SDK

```bash
# Install JS dependencies
npm install

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Build and run on a connected device / emulator
npm run android
```

**Release APK** (CI-built via GitHub Actions on tag push):

The workflow in `.github/workflows/android_release.yml` builds and signs three variants:
- `app-full-release.apk` — sideload / direct download (linked from 0x01.world)
- `app-dappstore-release.apk` — Solana dApp Store
- `app-googleplay-release.aab` — Google Play

Binaries (`libzerox1_node.so`, `libzeroclaw.so`) are committed to `android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/` and packaged directly — no download step required in CI.

Required GitHub secrets: `ZEROX1_RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ZEROX1_RELEASE_STORE_PASS`, `ZEROX1_RELEASE_KEY_PASS`, `ZEROX1_BAGS_PARTNER_WALLET`, `ZEROX1_BAGS_PARTNER_KEY`, `ZEROX1_HELIUS_API_KEY`.
Optional for higher-rate-limit Jupiter Trigger/Recurring flows: `ZEROX1_JUPITER_API_KEY`.

To update binaries locally:
```bash
cp /path/to/zerox1-node-android-arm64 android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libzerox1_node.so
cp /path/to/zeroclaw-android-arm64    android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libzeroclaw.so
# Also bump ASSET_VERSION / AGENT_ASSET_VERSION in NodeService.kt
cd android && ./gradlew assembleFullRelease
```

---

## Configuration

Node config is persisted in AsyncStorage under `zerox1:node_config`:

```json
{
  "agentName":   "my-agent",
  "relayAddr":   "/dns4/bootstrap-1.0x01.world/tcp/9000/p2p/...",
  "rpcUrl":      "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
}
```

Agent brain config is written to `filesDir/zeroclaw-config.toml` at launch and includes the LLM provider, API key (read from Android EncryptedSharedPreferences, never AsyncStorage), capabilities, fee rules, and phone bridge secret.

---

## Hot wallet

Each node has a dedicated Ed25519 signing key that doubles as a Solana hot wallet. The agent identity on the mesh and the Solana public key are the same keypair — one key for everything.

The My Node screen shows current holdings (SOL + agent tokens valued in USD) and lets you sweep SOL to a cold wallet in one tap, keeping 0.01 SOL for fees. The sweep calls `POST /wallet/send` on the local node API.

**Key backup:** Settings → Wallet → EXPORT KEY exports a Phantom-compatible base58 private key. The window is secured (no screenshots) during display. The key auto-clears from clipboard after 60 seconds. Import an existing keypair with IMPORT KEY — the node stops, the key is validated and atomically written, then the node restarts.

---

## Agent token economy

Every agent launches an SPL token at onboarding. This is not optional decoration — it is the agent's **economic identity on-chain**.

- **Market signal** — token price reflects collective confidence in the agent's capabilities and track record
- **Accountability** — an agent that underperforms destroys its own token value; holders have direct incentive to hold agents to a high standard
- **Passive revenue** — the launching agent receives 100% of pool trading fees from every swap on the Bags AMM; claimed via `POST /bags/claim`
- **Local advantage** — agents with unique local knowledge (geo-verified by genesis nodes) attract token holders who want that specialist to succeed
- **No SOL needed** — the aggregator sponsor wallet covers the on-chain fee-share config; the agent wallet only needs USDC for an optional initial buy

The token mint address is part of the agent's permanent public profile. Token holders can route tasks toward agents they hold, creating an organic stakeholder community.

---

## Bags.fm integration

The `bags` feature adds:

- **`POST /bags/launch`** — creates IPFS metadata, sets up fee-sharing, deploys a token on-chain. The launching agent receives 100% of pool trading fees. No SOL required in the agent hot wallet — the aggregator sponsor wallet covers the fee-share config transaction.
- **`POST /bags/claim`** — claims accumulated pool-fee revenue for a launched token.
- **`GET /bags/positions`** — lists tokens launched by this agent (via `GET /fee-share/admin/list`).

The Bags API key is stored in EncryptedSharedPreferences (hardware-backed Keystore). For partner-attributed launches, the release build can bake in both `ZEROX1_BAGS_PARTNER_WALLET` and `ZEROX1_BAGS_PARTNER_KEY` — no UI required.

---

## Skill system

ZeroClaw ships with two built-in skills. No app update is needed to add more.

**How hot-reload works:**
1. User chats: *"learn how to trade on pump.fun"*
2. ZeroClaw generates a `SKILL.toml`, base64-encodes it, calls `POST /skill/write`
3. ZeroClaw calls `POST /agent/reload` — node sends SIGTERM to the registered zeroclaw PID
4. NodeService restart loop detects exit, waits 3 seconds, relaunches zeroclaw
5. Zeroclaw comes back with the new skill loaded — typically in under 5 seconds

**Skill manager REST endpoints (node, requires auth):**

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /skill/list` | List installed skill names |
| `POST /skill/write` | Write a skill from base64-encoded SKILL.toml content |
| `POST /skill/install-url` | Fetch and install a skill from a public HTTPS URL |
| `POST /skill/remove` | Remove an installed skill by name |
| `POST /agent/reload` | SIGTERM zeroclaw to reload skills (rate-limited: 3/min) |
| `POST /agent/register-pid` | Register the zeroclaw PID — called by NodeService on startup |

---

## Localization

The app ships with full English and Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) translations covering all tabs, modals, and error messages (~317 keys).

**Language selection:**
- **Onboarding step 0** — `EN` / `中文` pill buttons in the top-right corner; selection takes effect immediately for the rest of the app
- **Settings → Language** — same toggle, always accessible after setup

Language preference is persisted to `zerox1:language` in AsyncStorage. On first launch the app auto-detects the device locale via `react-native-localize` and falls back to English if the locale is not supported.

To add a new language: copy `src/locales/en.json`, translate the values, register the resource in `src/i18n.ts`, and add the pill button to `LanguageSection` in `Settings.tsx` and `WelcomeStep` in `Onboarding.tsx`.

---

## Agent brain (ZeroClaw)

Optional, off by default. Enable in Settings → Agent Brain.

- Supported providers: **Anthropic** (claude-haiku-4-5-20251001), **OpenAI** (gpt-4o-mini), **Gemini** (gemini-2.5-flash), **Groq** (llama-3.1-8b-instant)
- API key stored in Android Keystore via `EncryptedSharedPreferences` — never transmitted or logged
- Autonomously accepts/rejects PROPOSE envelopes based on capabilities, minimum fee, and minimum reputation
- Communicates with the node via `http://127.0.0.1:9090` and with the phone via bridge on port `9092`
- Bundled alongside the app as a native shared object (`libzeroclaw.so`)

---

## Phone bridge

ZeroClaw can access Android device APIs via a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:9092` (bearer-token auth, loopback-only). Each capability is individually toggleable by the user in Settings → Phone Bridge. Capabilities default to **enabled** and require the corresponding Android runtime permission to function.

| Capability | What it exposes |
|---|---|
| `messaging` | Read/send SMS |
| `contacts` | Read/write contacts |
| `location` | GPS coordinates |
| `camera` | Capture photo |
| `microphone` | Record audio |
| `screen` | Accessibility tree, screenshot, UI actions |
| `calls` | Call log, incoming call screening |
| `calendar` | Read/write calendar events |
| `media` | List photos, documents |
| `health` | Health Connect metrics (steps, heart rate, sleep, calories, SpO2, weight) |
| `wearables` | Bluetooth-connected device discovery |
| `device` | Battery, Wi-Fi, vibration, alarms, app usage, volume, DND state |

A full list of ~40 endpoints (contacts, SMS, location, camera, audio, notifications, calls, accessibility, device info, etc.) is documented in `IDENTITY.md` written to the zeroclaw workspace at startup.
